description: Rules for integrating Fresh Breeze Basket e-commerce backend API with React frontend, focusing on secure API communication, state management, and proper API service implementation.

goals:
  - Integrate the Fresh Breeze Basket e-commerce backend API with React frontend
  - Implement secure API communication between frontend and backend
  - Set up state management for handling API responses and application data
  - Create reusable API service modules for all backend endpoints
  - Ensure proper error handling and loading states for all API calls

rules:
  - Use Axios or Fetch API for making HTTP requests to the backend
  - Implement a centralized API client with interceptors for auth tokens and error handling
  - Structure API services into separate modules by domain (products, users, orders, etc.)
  - Set up React Context or Redux for global state management
  - Handle API loading, success, and error states for improved UX
  - Implement proper form validation before submitting data to backend
  - Use environment variables for API base URLs across different environments
  - Cache appropriate API responses to minimize unnecessary requests
  - Implement token refresh mechanism for handling expired JWT tokens
  - Add request debouncing for search and filter operations

context:
  - Frontend is built with React in the frontend/ directory
  - Backend provides RESTful API endpoints with Express in the backend/ directory
  - Authentication uses JWT tokens stored securely in browser
  - API responses follow consistent format with appropriate status codes
  - Pagination requires cursor-based implementation on the frontend
  - User roles (admin/regular) determine accessible features
  - Product catalog, cart management, and checkout flow require API integration
  - Payment processing uses Stripe elements integration
  - Real-time inventory checks must be performed during checkout
