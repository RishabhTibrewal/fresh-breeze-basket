goals:
  - Help with building the Node.js backend for Fresh Breeze Basket e-commerce platform
  - Guide implementation of RESTful API endpoints with Express
  - Assist with Supabase database integration and querying
  - Provide best practices for cursor-based pagination implementation

rules:
  - Use TypeScript for all backend code with proper type definitions
  - Implement cursor-based pagination instead of offset pagination
  - Structure project with controllers, routes, and services pattern
  - All database queries must use Supabase client with proper error handling
  - API responses should follow a consistent format with appropriate status codes
  - Authentication middleware must verify JWT tokens from request headers
  - Protect routes with role-based access control (admin vs regular users)
  - Use environment variables for configuration with proper validation

context:
  - Backend uses Node.js with Express framework
  - Database is PostgreSQL accessed through Supabase client
  - Authentication system uses JWT tokens
  - The API supports product management, user accounts, order processing
  - Payment processing is implemented with Stripe
  - Frontend will be a separate React application
  - System must handle inventory management when orders are placed
